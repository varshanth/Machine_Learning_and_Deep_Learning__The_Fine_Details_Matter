## Convolutional Neural Network
### Let's Diverge for a second: What is convolution? (and why it should be called Cross Correlation-al Neural Network)
* Obviously: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution
* Notice the animation: Remember the convolution operation is the integration, so it is the area UNDER the curve.
